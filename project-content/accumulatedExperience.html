    <h1> Accumulated Human Experience </h1>
    <p>
        It's crazy to think that there are over 7 billion people living on this planet. Think about it! 7 billion minds experiencing life in an infinite variety of ways every single day-- and all this is happening in parallel. I like to think about this way: every single day 7 billion days worth of unique human experience accumulates around the globe.

        I find this idea absolutely fascinating when coupled with another idea: that many of us record and upload these experience to the internet. Experiences that would only be privy to the mind in which they were recorded are now availabe for other minds to ingest.

        I built the webpage listed below to help frame this idea of Accumulated Human Experience. It is the first iteration of this big idea and I hope to explore it further with different digital iterations in the future. Enjoy!

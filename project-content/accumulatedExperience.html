    <h1> Accumulated Human Experience </h1>
    <p>
        Recently, I've been ruminating on the idea that every single day people around the world internalize and manipulate the world around them. And all this is happening in parallel.
        In 1 day about 7 billion people experience life in an infinite variety of ways. In other words, 7 billion days worth of unique human experience accumulate in 1 day on this globe.
    </p>
    <p>
        I find this idea absolutely fascinating when coupled with another idea: that many of us record and upload these experiences to the internet, aka humanity's collective neural network.
        What the universal accessibility to this wealth of human experience will do to us humans is still a mystery to me.
        Nonetheless, I want to explore this idea more through different digital mediums. I hope to live my way into insights with each iteration.
